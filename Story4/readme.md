Story # 4 Files

I have introduced the term "Data Practitioner" as a generic job descriptor because we have so many different job role titles for individuals whose work activities overlap including Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Architect, etc.
For this story, we will answer the question, "How much do we get paid?" Your analysis and data visualizations must address the variation in average salary based on role descriptor and state.


For this story, I have found a dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries/data

This dataset contains salaries for various data practitioner positions found around the world

I will clean and wrangle the data using python pandas and use the Matplotlib library to visualize my findings.
