Story # 5

Historic data indicates that the occurrence and intensity of cyclonic storms (Hurricanes, Typhoons and Tornados) increases with the increased earth temperature. For this assignment you will need to tell this story to a non-technical audience (eg: a high-school earth science class).
Notes:
Source historic data for a period of at least 25 years on a measure of the earth's temperature.

Source data on the occurrence and intensity of hurricanes, typhoons and tornados for the same historic period.

Perform the data analysis to establish the correlations between earth temperature and storm occurrence and intensity.

Tell the story of this data and your analysis using data visualizations and other illustrations (eg: pictures of storm damage) in a presentation that will be accessible to a high-school earth science class.

This assignment is due at the end of the week ten of the semester.
