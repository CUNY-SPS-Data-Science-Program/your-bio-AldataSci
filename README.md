Hi there My name is Al Haque and I am currently 25 years old, I have recently graduated from Hunter College with a B.A in Mathematics, after struggling to find employment for a few months,
I've decided to pursue an M.S. in Data Science at the Cuny School of Professional Studies. I've greatly enjoyed learning about Data Analytics, Machine-Learning,  R, and Python during my time here and I
only strive to get better.
